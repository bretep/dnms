Implementation

The goal here is to create a few layers that in themselves create something useful

Base parts:
    - Memberlist: our peers on the network to talk to
    - Mapper: responsible for mapping the network based on who is in the memberlist
    - Pinger: ping all peers in the network-- specifically to hit all routes in the mapper

TODO:
    - fault detection: using events from pinger/mapper correlate which links we
        think are having issues
    - aggregation
        -- switch from pull to push
        -- route around nodes that can't talk to aggregation nodes
        -- auto-sharding (probably based on peername)
    - IPv6 support (traceroute etc.)
    - memberlist: use the meta field
        -- include "role"
        -- include http endpoint info (port at least)?

In the future:
    - support TCP pings
    - Better UI
        -- separate views for graph vs routes etc.
        -- visualization for latency / loss / etc

Metrics to figure out:
    - how many times a route flops over to a new one (route changes)
    - average routes per peer?
    - average latency for a link
        -- diff the times for ICMP between the 2 nodes, keep a rolling average
            average all the various routes' measured latencies?
