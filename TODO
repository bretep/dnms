Implementation

The goal here is to create a few layers that in themselves create something useful

Base parts:
    - Memberlist: our peers on the network to talk to
    - Mapper: responsible for mapping the network based on who is in the memberlist
    - Pinger: ping all peers in the network-- specifically to hit all routes in the mapper

Parts TODO:
    - fault detection: using events from pinger/mapper correlate which links we
        think are having issues

General TODO:
    - Metrics
        -- global counters (total)
            - successful/failed pings
            - successful/failed maps
        -- gauges (current count)
            -- current peers
            -- current routes (+ per-state)
            -- current nodes
            -- current edges
        -- some "graph" metrics (connectivity, etc.)
    - REST API endpoint
