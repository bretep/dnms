TODO:
    - fault detection: using events from pinger/mapper correlate which links we
        think are having issues
    - aggregation
        -- switch from pull to push
        -- route around nodes that can't talk to aggregation nodes
        -- auto-sharding (probably based on peername)
    - memberlist: use the meta field
        -- include "role"
        -- include http endpoint info (port at least)?
    - configs
        - configurable ping rate
        - configurable map rate
        - metric update events (on routes)
    - Better pings
        - send multiple packets
            -- measure jitter
            -- check ordering
    - separate the traceroute lib into a CLI + lib
    - Cleanup state serialization -- preferrably a string instead of a uint8 (up/suspect/down instead of 0/1/2)

In the future:
    - support TCP pings
    - Better UI
        -- separate views for graph vs routes etc.
        -- visualization for latency / loss / etc

Metrics to figure out:
    - how many times a route flops over to a new one (route changes)
    - average routes per peer?
    - average latency for a link
        -- diff the times for ICMP between the 2 nodes, keep a rolling average
            average all the various routes' measured latencies?
